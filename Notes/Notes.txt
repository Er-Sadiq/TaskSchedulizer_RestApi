what is this ?
this is a simple task schedular that effectively manages and distrubutes task among works 

here is how it is going to work:

# schedular
1) recivers task and time in the form of string from the client 

2) stores it in db 


#Coordinator
3) selects and distrubutes these tasks among the workers based on their schedules

4) manages worker registration and check their status


# worker
5) perform the task provided by Coordinator and report back status

6) registrates and send a heartbeat signal 

#mysql and docker file to wrap this project

curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/taskschedulizer -d '{"task":"Do laundry", "time":"2024-09-21T14:00:00Z"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"
